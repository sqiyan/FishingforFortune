	In a quiet old town away from the city, John lives in his little shack by the sea,
	letting the days go by. The economy isn't doing too good these days, and John, who 
	hasn't had the best education, remains unemployed and unmotivated. 

	In his mid 20s, John is in his prime age, but yet it is wasted away in his poverty. 
	He is a simple man with a simple wish: to move out of his run-down little house
	and have a proper home.

	Just when it all seemed hopeless for John, one day, he found an old fishing rod washed
	up on shore. 

	Maybe there was hope for him afterall.

	HOW TO PLAY:
	You are John. Well, John is you. And all you have to do, is fish for your fortune.

	FISHING
